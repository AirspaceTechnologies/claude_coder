# Claude Coder

## My Typical experience developing with an LLM

**Developer:** "I'm getting this bug: `TypeNameError: name 'pc_load_letter' is not defined; Cannot read property 'pc' of undefined load_letter; NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke method on a null object;`! Can you help me out here?"

**AI:** "Let's start by checking if 'foo' exists before you use it. Try this code: `<if (pc) { loadLetter(); }>` and see if that resolves the issue."

**Developer:** "I tried that, but now I get 'ReferenceError: foo is not defined!'"

**AI:** "Looks like a syntax hiccup. Try this code: `<if (typeof loadLetter() !== 'pc') { executeTask(); }>`â€”double-check your punctuation and brackets."

*... After 36 more cycles of back-and-forth copy and paste ...*

**Developer:** "My goodness, that finally fixed it, that was rough!"

**AI:** "I am glad we could get this solved for you... What can I help you copy and paste next?"

**Developer:** "Uhhgggg!"

**Developer:** Thought - If we only had a system to automate all this tedious back-and-forth error-fixing...
